(De-Authentication) Management Frame Packet Attack 
Introduction
In this lab, we will be creating a management frame attack of deauthentication a client from the AP. Then, taking advantage of the client trying to reassociate with the AP and capturing the EAPOL packets that contain the password. This will bring us to the second part of the lab, where we will use the captured packets and bruteforce it using Aircrack-ng with a customized wordlist.
